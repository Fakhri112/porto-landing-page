# My Portfolio Page

This portfolio is a personal project built with Svelte and Tailwind CSS to showcase my skills and experience as a web developer, particularly passionate about Front-End development (especially React!) ðŸ’»

## Features

- Built with Svelte: Utilizing the power of Svelte for a performant and reactive user interface.
- Tailwind CSS for Styling: Tailwind's utility-first approach provides a clean and efficient way to style the portfolio.
- Minimalist Design: The focus is on clarity and simplicity, letting your projects and skills shine.
- Smooth Transitions: Subtle animations enhance the overall user experience. GSAP and Swiper.js really help me a lot

## Developing

Once you've created a project and installed dependencies with `npm install` (or `pnpm install` or `yarn`), start a development server:

```bash
npm run dev

# or start the server and open the app in a new browser tab
npm run dev -- --open
```

## Building

To create a production version of your app:

```bash
npm run build
```

You can preview the production build with `npm run preview`.

> To deploy your app, you may need to install an [adapter](https://kit.svelte.dev/docs/adapters) for your target environment.
